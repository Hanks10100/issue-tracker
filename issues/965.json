  "body": "It seems that current length value works like rem. When I set a text style as `font-size: 32`, it seems ok in iPhone6, but for earlier devices such as iPhone 5S or iPhone 5, the text becomes smaller than iPhone6. That's why I think weex current length works as rem in html5.\n\nSo my question is, is it possible to set a fixed length value which works as normal `px` in the browser?\n",
