  "body": "We don't have any inline level components yet, the `<text>` component is block level by default, indeed, it will compiled to `<div>` on the web. We can't achieve to write two words in one line with different colors or font style.\r\n\r\n## Proposal\r\n\r\nI think we should support to use `<span>` component. To simplify the implementation, we can add a convention that **`<span>` must be the child of `<text>`**, as well as other inline-level components.\r\n\r\n## Example\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div>\r\n    <text>\r\n        <span style=\"color:red\">R</span>\r\n        <span style=\"color:green\">G</span>\r\n        <span style=\"color:blue\">B</span>\r\n    </text>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis demo should render the string `RGB` with three different colors.\r\n\r\n## What's More\r\n\r\n+ `<em>`, `<i>`, `<b>`, `<strong>`, `<small>`, could also be supported. (maybe it's not necessary)\r\n+ If we support `display: inline-block;`, It would be much easier to achieve rich text (#835).\r\n+ It's possible to create a `<markdown>` component without writing native codes.\r\n",
