  "body": "I have looked through the documentation at http://alibaba.github.io/weex/doc/ and can't find how weex can support Geolocation. I am making a Weather app using Weex like \n- Swift Weather: https://github.com/JakeLin/SwiftWeather \n- React Native Weather: https://github.com/JakeLin/ReactNativeWeather\n\nI need to get the current location to display the weather info. In React Native, we can do it like https://github.com/JakeLin/ReactNativeWeather/blob/master/src/components/WeatherView.js#L75\n\n```\n startLocationSearch() {\n    navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(\n      location => {\n        this.queryOpenWeatherMap(location);\n      },\n      error => {\n        this.setState({\n          message: error.message || error\n        });\n      },\n      {enableHighAccuracy: true, timeout: 2000, maximumAge: 1000}\n    );\n  }\n```\n\nThanks\nJake \n"
