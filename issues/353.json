If a 'touchstart' event has been triggered, the source target will be the list item, not the list, and the event will not bubble up to the list. Sadly the list will need the 'touchstart' event to scroll, otherwise there will be no response from the list to the touch events. \n\nEVEN IF there is a bubbling up mechanism like pass array of multiple 'ref's to callJS, the list still won't scroll, because there's no event binding on the list.\n\nUNLESS:\n1. There is a 'touchstart' event binding on the list, and also there is a bubbling up mechanism implemented by us like pass array of 'ref's to callJS, and then it will work, else it will fail.\n   \n   ```\n   <list ontouchstart=\"handleTouchstart\">\n     <div class=\"list-item\" ontouchstart=\"handleTouchstart\">\n   </list>\n   ```\n2.

But there will be one event firing in the virtual DOM tree through the renderer-jsframework bridge. I set a flag  `_alreadyFired` in the event object for the bubbling-up recognization. (Furthermore, the difference between the event's currentTarget and srcElement can tell us whether it is a bubbling up event handler or just another event handler binding on the same target. )\n"
