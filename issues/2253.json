The logo initially reads as \"**wee** inside\".\r\n\r\nYou may or may not be aware that [\"wee\" is a commonly used slang term for \"urinate\" or \"penis\"](http://onlineslangdictionary.com/meaning-definition-of/wee).\r\n\r\nUnfortunately this means the logo initially appears rather sexually suggestive. Mildly amusing, but probably not the intention.\r\n\r\nJust letting you know."
