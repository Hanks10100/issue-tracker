  "body": "Hola! @huixisheng has created a [ZenHub](http://www.zenhub.com) account for the **alibaba** organization. ZenHub is the only project management tool integrated natively in GitHub – created specifically for fast-moving, software-driven teams.\n\n----\n\n#### How do I use ZenHub?\n\nTo get set up with ZenHub, all you have to do is **[download the browser extension](https://www.zenhub.com?utm_source=ZHOnboarding)** and log in with your GitHub account. Once you do, you’ll get access to ZenHub’s complete feature-set immediately.\n\n#### What can ZenHub do?\n\nZenHub adds a series of enhancements directly inside the GitHub UI:\n\n- Real-time, customizable task boards for GitHub issues;\n- Multi-Repository burndown charts, estimates, and velocity tracking based on GitHub Milestones;\n- Personal to-do lists and task prioritization;\n- Time-saving shortcuts – like a quick repo switcher, a “Move issue” button, and much more.\n\n### [Add ZenHub to GitHub](https://www.zenhub.com?utm_source=ZHOnboarding)\n\n_Still curious?
