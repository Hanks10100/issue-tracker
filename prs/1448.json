The `jsfm-feature-0.17` and `html5-feature-0.5` is for the next develop iteration.\n\nBecause of the file structure of `html5/` has been changed in `jsfm-feature-0.17`, the `html5-feature-0.5` branch should sync those changes before add new features.\n\nI have already merged `jsfm-feature-0.17` into `html5-feature-0.5`, and fix the conflicts manually. I think `jsfm-feature-0.17` should sync those changes back.\n"
