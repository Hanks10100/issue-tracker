  "body": "Just as the title. When `callNative(instanceId, tasks)` called in JavaScript (without 3rd parameter), the 3rd parameter will be finally converted into a string `\"undefined\"` to `WXBridgeContext.m` and not be skiped. So another `callJS(instanceId, { type: \"callback\", args: [\"undefined\"] })` will be called back into JavaScript. And then infinite loop between like `callNative(instanceId, updateFinish)` and `callJS(instanceId, \"undefined\")` on and on...\n\nAs the callback feature not be used in JS Framework any more, to prevent this unexpected thing happens in the future. So I added `![callback isEqualToString:@\"undefined\"]` here and especially as the first condition. And then `![callback isEqualToString:@\"-1\"]` as the second. Actually the falsy `callback` never happens but as the consideration of robustness I preserved it as the last condition.\n\nThanks.\n"
