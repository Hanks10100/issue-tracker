Notice that CoreImage will automatically choose the best way to create a CIContext in order of Metal, OpenGLES, and CoreGraphics. \r\n     > * On real devices, it will be Metal for iOS8+A7, and OpenGLES for others. \r\n     > * Simulators don't support Metal, so it will be OpenGLES. But implementations of OpenGLES in simulator are only similar to a real device, performance differs a lot referring to [Apple Docs][1]. \r\n     > * It runs smoothly in a real device, but takes a while in simulator.\r\n  * add attribute \"scrollable\" to slider, scroller, sliderNeighbor component\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]: https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/iOS_Simulator_Guide/TestingontheiOSSimulator/TestingontheiOSSimulator.html",
